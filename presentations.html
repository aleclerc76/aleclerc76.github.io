            <div id="slidesCata" class="abstract" onclick="toggleVisibility('slidesCata')">The space of measures with finite second moment, when endowed with the Wasserstein distance, is a geodesic space but not a vector space. Therefore, building an adequate differential calculus is not straightforward, and currently subject of debate in the literature. We review the main definitions in use in the Hamilton-Jacobi and Mean Fields communities, with examples illustrating the nature of the objects and comments on the range and limitations of each point of view.</div>

            <div id="posterFoCM23" class="abstract" onclick="toggleVisibility('posterFoCM23')">We consider optimal control problems over the Wasserstein space. On the one hand, there is now a stable theory of absolutely continuous curves of measures, characterized as the solutions of the continuity equation. In particular, for sufficiently regular dynamics, the trajectories enjoy a nice representation as the pushforward through the semigroup of the underlying ODE. On the other hand, control problems are naturally linked to the viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. Our aim is to contribute to the extension of the viscosity theory over the Wasserstein space. We explore the choice of a particular set of test functions, including the squared distance, that allows us to obtain a weak comparison principle and verify that the value function of the control problem is the unique Lipschitz and bounded solution of the corresponding HJ equation. In addition, this choice bears strong links with subdifferential notions of the literature.</div>

            <div id="slidesSMAI" class="abstract" onclick="toggleVisibility('slidesSMAI')">We consider a deterministic control problem with finite horizon. On the one hand, the discretization of the Dynamical Programming Principle (DPP) by mesh-based methods suffers from the curse of dimensionality. On the other hand, the discretized DPP is naturally formulated as a chain of optimization problems. Following the ideas of [Huré, Pham, Bachouch and Langrené 2022] in the stochastic setting, we consider a semi-Lagrangian scheme where the value function at each time step is represented by a neural network. This scheme is applied to an obstacle problem arising from a state-constrained control problem, and some elements of analysis are given in this context. Numerical illustrations are given for dimensions between 2 and 8.</div>

This talk will focus on some advances in the direction of test functions. We introduce the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to control problems in a general context in order to highlight the intuition behind it, then decline it in the Wasserstein context. We discuss how to overcome two of the arising difficulties by adapting the notion of viscosity. This allows us to obtain some results of comparison and uniqueness of the solution of a suitable HJ equation.</div>

The right notion of solution seems to be viscosity solutions, that are, in a sense, maximal. This remark opens on an analytical method of resolution very close to the spectral decomposition of linear operators, and highlights the deep connection between viscosity and control problems.</div>
